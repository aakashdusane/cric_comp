# Predictions

# Winner of the Series

Pick: INDIA

India currently has a much better form in ODIs. They also have the home advantage. In India the pitches are more flat generally so it’s easier to bat. Also, India has won most of their games when Kedar Jadhav was in the team.

India's win percent in all ODIs for the last two years is around 77% while Australia's is only 18.75%

# Series Output

Pick: INDIA 3 - 2 AUSTRALIA

Although India have the home advantage, they will find it difficult to whitewash the series. These are the last 5 ODI matches for the Indian team before they head into the World Cup and are still trying to find the perfect team combination and may not play their best XI for every match to give the bench some game time. Therefore it is possible they may lose a couple of games.

Australia have good pace bowlers compared to India. Besides generally being a good pitch for bowlers, Mohali is also good for pace.

# Highest run scorer

Pick: Rohit Sharma

By analyzing "most carreer runs against opposition", "most 6s in a single match against opposition", "Most runs from 4s + 6s against oppostion" only one player stands out and that is Rohit Sharma.

# Highest wicket-taker

Pick: Y Chahal

Indian conditions tend to favour spin bowlers. Historically Australian batsmen have not been good players of spin. India's leg-spinning duo, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal have built a very succesful partnership and they regularly take wickets in the middle overs.

pace bowler Kane richardson is out, which will make life tougher for Australia and thus will not be able to take full advantage of pitch at Mohali.

# Player with Maximum sixes¶

Pick: Rohit Sharma

The player with the most sixes would be a toss-up between Rohit Sharma and Glen Maxwell. They both can hit the ball a long way but Rohit Sharma may emerge as the victor in this clash as Glen Maxwell plays as a floater in the Australian middle order (Therefore is less likely to face a large amount of balls). There is a direct correlation between number of 6's and balls faced. It's become common to see him bat at the no. 7 position which means he will get lesser time in the middle than Rohit Sharma and lesser opportunities to hit a sixer.

# Player with Maximum fours

Pick: Rohit Sharma

Analyzing "most 6s in a single match against opposition", "Most runs from 4s + 6s against oppostion" we can safely say that player with the maximum sixes (and starts early in the game) is more likely to also be the player with maximum 4s. Although Virat Kohli is also in contention for this spot as we can see by the "4s vs 6s" plot.
